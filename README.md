# Lbox
These are my lmaobox scripts I've pasted/chatgpted. I'm not good at coding.

Better air lua disables crouch in air while ctrl is being held & only applies directional autostrafe while space is being held (so you can air brake).

Lurch backtrack increments fake latency so the backtrack window stays in roughly the same location (relative to the world).

Faststop removes the "slide" after you let go of a movement key. This is really not a good way of doing it, but i'm retarded so ðŸ¤·
